   <h1> Save Plants, Save Life </h1>
    <p>Pants are the foundation of life on Earth. They give us oxygen to breathe, food to eat, and help keep our environment clean and balanced.<br>  
       By protecting plants, planting more trees, and stopping deforestation, we can create a healthier and greener world for ourselves and future generations.</p>
